AutoMainTain

This is my second project as a developer. I was tasked with building my backend API and my frontend client. I kept the front end basic because when I started messing around with CSS, and things started to break, so I focused more on functionality.
The technologies used were Ruby on Rails, Ruby, for the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax on the front end.

AutoMainTain is an application that is designed to track vehicle maintenance.
The focus of the application is for a user to be able to enter a vehicle, and
it's information such as VIN number, Make, Model, Year, and Ownership date.
Once this information is entered, all maintenance records entered belong to the vehicle based on the VIN number since every car has a unique VIN number.

When planning for my application, I started with my user stories, and wire frames. I used those as a list of things to get done to stay on task. Coming up with the idea for my project brought me back to my prior career as an Auto Technician.  I noticed it was hard to find out maintenance history about a vehicle once it was out of warranty, or if the customer stopped bringing the car to the dealership.  In the app, a user would be able to voluntarily input their car into the database. Once it is in the database, they would be able to upload documents/receipts pictures, and proof of repairs done to the car, and it would stay with that car in the database. The information would be public, so if someone wanted to look up the maintenance history of a vehicle they were interested in buying on the used market, they would be able to see it, by looking up the VIN as long as someone had entered it into the database
