AutoMainTain is an application that is designed to track vehicle maintenance.
The focus of the application is for a user to be able to enter a vehicle, and
it's information such as VIN number, Make, Model, Year, and Ownership date.
Once this information is entered, all maintenance records entered belong to the vehicle based on the VIN number since every car has a unique VIN number.
